# Space-Weather-Modeling-with-CHAMP-and-JB2008-Data

## Overview

This Python program is designed to analyze and model space weather phenomena by leveraging data from the CHAMP satellite mission and the JB2008 density model. It focuses on understanding how Earth's upper atmosphere behaves in response to solar activity, making it a valuable tool for space weather researchers and enthusiasts.

## Features

- Data Extraction: Extracts data from the CHAMP satellite mission and the JB2008 density model, enabling in-depth analysis.

- Interpolation: Utilizes RegularGridInterpolator from SciPy to interpolate density data along the CHAMP satellite trajectory.

- Visualization: Generates visualizations to help users understand the dynamic interactions between solar radiation, geodetic parameters, and atmospheric density.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib
